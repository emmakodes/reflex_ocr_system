# reflex_ocr_system
This app enables users to upload an image then the app extracts the text of the image to output to the user.

This app idea is brought out of the fact that sometimes I would want to use the text of an image but I don't want to type the text all over so I can just use this solution to extract
the text of the image.

# The following is the output of the app
